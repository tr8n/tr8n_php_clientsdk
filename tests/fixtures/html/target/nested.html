[div: MyHeritage was founded by a [link: team of people]
    with a passion for genealogy and a strong grasp of Internet technology. Our vision has been to make it easier for people
    around the world to use the power of the Internet to discover their heritage and strengthen their bonds with family and friends.
    {br}{br}As of 2005, we were based in the beautiful village of Bnei Atarot, near Tel Aviv, Israel, founded by German Templers in
    1902 under the name of Wilhelma.{br}{br}Inspired by the surrounding fields and orchards and Templer estates, one of which served
    as our headquarters, we used the tools of tomorrow for researching the family history of yesterday. In February 2012 following
    our constant growth, we moved into lovely new offices in Or Yehuda, Israel. We also have offices in the USA in Lehi, Utah and LA,
    California, and employees and representatives in many countries around the world.{br}As a dynamic family history network, our innovations
    for family tree building and historical content search are constantly evolving to provide families with the most engaging and rewarding experience.
    Our recent acquisitions of World Vital Records and Geni.com for example, have enabled us to offer billions of historical records and exciting tools for
    collaboration to a wider and more international audience than ever before. {br}If you are passionate like us about researching what made you the way you are,
    and sharing your experiences with family members and friends, then MyHeritage is the place for you.]
