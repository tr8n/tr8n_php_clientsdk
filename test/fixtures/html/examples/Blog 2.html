<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be exciting to read the diary of an ancestor who recorded his or her daily activities?</p>

<p>Matt Unger, a 40-ish software executive in New York, was handed his grandfather Harry Scheurman&rsquo;s 1924 diary, written when he was 29 and had been in the US for 11 years. Matt has transcribed each journal entry at his website <a href="http://papasdiary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://papasdiary.blogspot.com</a>. Scheurman had immigrated from Sniatyn, then in Austro-Hungary.</p>

<p>Matt&rsquo;s project received coverage in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/nyregion/thecity/14blog.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>As we hear more frequently these days, family history researchers are getting bitten by the genealogy bug at ever younger ages. Although Matt was given the pocket-sized diary for a fifth-grade family history project, it wasn&#39;t until Thanksgiving 2007 that he examined it closely and decided to transcribe it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.myheritage.com?utm_source=ppc_social&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_campaign=reg&amp;tr_ad_group=twtr_en" target="_blank">MyHeritage</a> interviewed Matt via email and is happy to offer his comments on this wonderful and very personal project. <a class="more-link" href="http://blog.myheritage.com/2013/10/our-stories-papa%e2%80%99s-diary/#more-33420">Continue reading &quot;Our Stories: Papa&rsquo;s Diary&quot; &raquo;</a></p>
