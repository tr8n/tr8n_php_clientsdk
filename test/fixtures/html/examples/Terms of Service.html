MyHeritage.com is an online service that allows members to create profiles and family sites in order to build and print their family trees, share family photos, keep in touch with family members, and research their family history with advanced research tools (the &quot;Service&quot;). The Service is owned and operated by MyHeritage Ltd. (hereafter &#39;we&#39;, &#39;our&#39; or &#39;us&#39;). &#39;You&#39; or &#39;your&#39; means an adult user, over the age of 13, of the Service (in some countries the minimum age is 14, see Section &quot;Underage Users&quot; below).

Please read them carefully, because by using the Website you agree to be bound by them and to enter into an agreement with us based on such Terms and Conditions (the &quot;Agreement&quot;), whether or not you register as a member in MyHeritage.com (&quot;Member&quot;). The Website is part of a group of websites that we own and operate (the &quot;MyHeritage Website Group&quot;) which also includes, among others, WorldVitalRecords.com and FamilyLink.com.<br />

<br />
<strong>MyHeritage.com Family Sites</strong><br />
MyHeritage.com allows you, as a Member, to create and post content into MyHeritage.com family sites, and enables you to control and limit access to such content by other users on the MyHeritage Website Group. In view of the nature of the Service, please select carefully the information you wish to post on MyHeritage.com family sites and refrain from posting any illegal or unsuitable content. We will not edit or monitor user-provided content, but we reserve the right to remove any user provided content which comes to our attention and which, in our sole discretion, breaches this Agreement.<br />
<br />
By way of illustration, and without limitation, you shall refrain from posting, transmitting, sending or otherwise making available, through or in connection with the Service, the following:
<ul>
	<li>Photographs and other content which include nudity, sexuality, pornography, indecency, vulgarity, violence and/or any offensive subject matter.</li>
	<li>Any content which may violate the privacy or breach the confidentiality of other people, including members in your family tree. Our Service allows you to define specific privacy settings regarding individual names, dates, email addresses and other personally identifying information. Please make use of these abilities and respect the privacy of others.</li>
	<li>Any photos or email addresses of living individuals (other than your own), if done without their consent.</li>
	<li>Any information relating to minors, which identifies them, their personal details or their address and other means of communication with them, without the direct consent of their parent or guardian.</li>
	<li>Any content which does not belong to you or which you do not have a right to use.</li>
	<li>Any content that impairs and/or infringes the property or other rights of others, including copyrights and trademarks. We are extremely sensitive to the copyright and other intellectual property rights of others. Be aware that content, including photographs, even if submitted to a site of which you are a Member, belongs to its creator or submitter and you should not reproduce it without permission of the owner.</li>
	<li>Any content which is obscene, indecent, defamatory, derogatory, fraudulent, degrading, abusive, hateful, false, misleading, inaccurate, untrue, malicious, offensive, harassing, threatening, or incites racial, religious or ethnic hatred.</li>
	<li>Any content that causes anyone alarm, annoyance, anxiety, embarrassment, offence or distress.</li>
	<li>Any content that could prejudice any active legal proceedings of which you are aware; is unlawful or promotes or teaches unlawful activity.</li>
	<li>Any computer virus or other malicious or harmful code.</li>
	<li>Any content that violates our <a class="green" href="http://www.myheritage.com/FP/Company/popup.php?p=privacy_policy" target="_top">Privacy policy</a>.</li>

	<li>Hold yourself out as an employee or representative of MyHeritage Ltd. or any of its affiliates.</li>
	<li>Stalk or harass or make persistent or regular contact with other users without their consent or encouragement or after any consent or encouragement has, expressly or impliedly, been withdrawn.</li>
	<li>Send commercial emails, SPAM emails, unsolicited bulk mail or any other email which may harass its recipient.</li>

	<li>Advertise or offer to sell products or services, except where this is expressly permitted by us and by law (in which case you must comply with any terms relating to such activities that we specify).</li>
	<li>Include links on our Website or Service to third party websites outside the MyHeritage Website Group.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Except with our express prior written consent, you must not copy or store electronically all or part of our Website or its contents, or make available, distribute, sell or offer to sell all or any part of the Website or its contents, or systematically download content and data from or through the Website to make or populate another database for any purpose. Scraping, crawling and/or harvesting of any data and any pages from the Website without our explicit prior written consent is strictly prohibited.<br />
<br />
Any activity in the framework of the Website, that is brought to our attention and is in violation of applicable law, as determined in our sole discretion, will be brought to the attention of the proper authorities.<br />
<br />
A MyHeritage family site is a place where members share their content with other members. This may create conflicts between members. The following guidelines apply to all MyHeritage members, including you:
<ul>
	<li>Members must obtain permission from living family members before uploading information about them to a family site, and if they still do so without their permission, it is the responsibility of the family site&rsquo;s owner &ndash; the Member who created the family site.</li>
	<li>If we receive a complaint about information being on a family site about a person or close relative of a person, against this person&rsquo;s wish, we reserves the right to delete that information from the family site even if the owner of the family site wants to keep the information there. In case of a dispute with the Member who owns the site, we are allowed to ban this Member and remove them from the Service at our discretion. If the Member is a Premium or PremiumPlus subscriber, the Member&rsquo;s subscription payment will be refunded to this Member by us.</li>
	<li>The right of a relative to request not to be listed in a family site is stronger than the right of the owner of the site to list that relative in a family site.</li>
	<li>If a person has personal information in a family site that was entered by another member that they want removed, they should email a request to <a class="green" href="mailto:support@myheritage.com">support@myheritage.com</a> and give us up to one week to process this request. We will attempt to first resolve the dispute amicably by contacting the owner of the family site who has entered the information or is responsible for it, and give them time to respond.</li>
	<li>Copying information or photos from other family sites without the permission of their owners is prohibited and members who do this are at risk of being banned from the Service at the discretion of MyHeritage Ltd.</li>
	<li>Inviting other members to your family site, or accepting their membership requests, will give these members access to the family site and they might copy parts of it. If that happens, it is the responsibility of the owner of the family site, or of the Member who made the invitation or has accepted the membership request, and not of MyHeritage Ltd. If an invitation was made in error or a membership request was accepted in error, the owner of the family site can remove that member from the family site to revoke his or her access to it.</li>
	<li>Family sites are open by default to visitors but details of living family in the tree are censored. For maximum privacy, site owners can turn their sites private, turn the photo albums private and turn off Smart Matching&trade; on their family trees.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Smart Matching&trade; is a service that makes discoveries by finding matches of your family tree with other family trees, but this benefit comes with a privacy drawback; that owners of other family sites can see parts of your family tree that was matched with theirs (except living people in your tree who will remain censored). If this is a concern to you, you must turn off Smart Matching&trade; by going to the &quot;Manage trees&quot; page in your family site&rsquo;s &quot;Family Tree&quot; tab, clicking the &quot;Tree settings&quot; link and unchecking the &quot;Enable Smart Matching&quot; option and clicking the &quot;Save&quot; button. If you leave Smart Matching&trade; enabled for your family tree, you are taking responsibility that other members may see parts of your family tree.<br />
<br />
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any content posted by you and/or any family site, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website and/or Service at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without any liability, financial or otherwise. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any family site at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without any liability, financial or otherwise, if we deem that the family site is in breach of this Agreement in any way.<br />
<br />
Once you upload, post or publish content to the Website, including family trees and photos, it may become accessible to all persons accessing the Website or any websites in the MyHeritage Website Group, depending on permission settings in your control. Based on your permission settings, other Website users may be able to view, copy, download, store, edit, change or delete certain content that you post. You agree that other users may access your family site and may add to, subtract from or otherwise amend your family site. Information that you post will be displayed and is available for others to search, view or hear.<br />
<br />
You may delete content that you previously posted on the Website; however, if others have downloaded or otherwise stored copies of the content, it may still be publicly viewable.<br />
<br />
Other users may contact you through our Website regarding the content you upload to assist with their research. We may send you an email notification when you have a new message on our Website. You can change your email settings in the &quot;My Account&quot; area of the Website if you prefer not to receive such notification.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyHeritage.com Celebrity Demo</strong><br />
The MyHeritage.com Celebrity Demo allows you to upload photographs to our free Face Recognition service, for the purpose of finding celebrity look-alikes. Photographs submitted by you to our face recognition demo are not shared with any third party. They remain stored on MyHeritage.com where they may be viewed from your Member profile page. You can choose to delete your photos, or keep them private so only you could access them.<br />
<br />
If you wish to use our &quot;Tell a Friend&quot; feature to email your friends a link to a photo you have uploaded with celebrity resemblances, please be aware that the link to your photo will remain valid for two days at most, after which it will stop working to protect your privacy.<br />

We retain the right, at our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement or the Service at any time. Changes in Service will be posted on the Website. If any portion of this Agreement or any change of this Agreement of the Service is unacceptable to you or will cause you to no longer be in compliance with the Agreement, you should discontinue use of the Service. Continued use of the Service now or following changes in this Agreement means that you have accepted and are bound by the changes.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Underage Users</strong><br />
We require individuals to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account on MyHeritage. In some jurisdictions, the age limit may be higher. Providing false information to create an account is always a violation of this Agreement. This includes accounts registered on the behalf of under 13 year old children by older parties.<br />
<br />
If your underage child (child under the age of 13) has created an account on MyHeritage, you can show them how to delete their account by having them log into their account, select &quot;Account settings&quot; from the Account menu in the top-right corner,<br />
then click &quot;Delete my account&quot;. If you would like to report an account registered for an underage child to us, please email the details to us at <a class="green" href="mailto:support@myheritage.com">support@myheritage.com</a>. We will promptly delete the account of any child under the age of 13 that is reported to us.<br />
<br />
In most jurisdictions, the Service requires individuals to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account. We strive to create a global service with consistent standards for everyone, but we also strive to respect local laws. In observance of laws in Spain, Israel and South Korea, we require individuals living there to be at least 14 years old before they can create an account and use the Service. If your underage child (child under the age of 14) living in Spain, Israel or South Korea has created an account on MyHeritage, you can show them how to delete their account by having them log into their account, select &quot;Account settings&rdquo; from the Account menu in the top-right corner, then click &quot;Delete my account&quot;. If you would like to report an account registered for an underage child living in Spain, Israel or South Korea to us, please email the details to us at <a class="green" href="mailto:support@myheritage.com">support@myheritage.com</a>. We will promptly delete the account of any child under the age of 14 in Spain, Israel or South Korea that is reported to us.<br />

Minors (people under the age of 18) can use the Service provided that they are not underage (see section on Underage Users above), and provided that they obtain the consent of their parent or guardian for their use of the Service (&quot;Consent&quot;). Minors must not use the Service without Consent until they reach the age of 18 or above.<br />
<br />
In some countries, the Service may display a special mandatory parent/guardian consent form when a user determined to be a minor signs up or logs into the Service. In the consent form, a parent or guardian is required to enter their full name and email address and to check boxes that declare that they are a parent or guardian of the minor, accept this Agreement and the privacy policy of the Service, and take responsibility for the for user of the Service by the minor. If the consent form is displayed, the Service cannot be used until it is filled out. If the user is not a Minor, the form allows for the user to declare this and enter a correct year of birth. When the consent form is filled out and submitted, the Service will document the details of the Consent but will not make any further use of the details of the parent or guardian filled in the consent form.<br />
